# UltimateRender

This program is able to render Blender Files with the maximum Performance by using CPU and GPU at one time

Additionally you can set up your own RenderFarm with computers in the same network. Only the Server has to have acces to the Blender Files,
the rendered files will be stored on the specified location on the server's file system (they will be transferred via TCP from the clients as well as
the needed Blender Files).
